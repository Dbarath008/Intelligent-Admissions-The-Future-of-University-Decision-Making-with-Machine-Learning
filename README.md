# University Admission Prediction

## Intelligent Admissions: The Future of University Decision Making with Machine Learning

[Video Demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MjIa3aD7EClZ2EFKlYMKP-p44AyGjL6I/view?usp=share_link)

This project currently makes use of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

Local execution doesn't require these web services and may need some code modifications to be run locally, provided that all the necessary python packages are installed.

It currently loads the dataset, generated model file and other html templates from my personal google drive. So running the interactive python notebooks require that the repo be cloned to the root of your google drive ie. "My Drive", the essential directories are dataset,flask and training.

[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sri60787/admission-predict) and [Project files - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18ckfI-cSmFI5uR_481YODzB9EkzVEX_V?usp=sharing)

Be Responsible! Do not use my ngrok Authtoken !!!

Not a professional or hobby project.

Created for Project based Experimental Learning with NaanMudhalvan-SmartInternz(SmartBridge).
